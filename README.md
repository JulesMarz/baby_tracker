Task:
Create a dashboard with graphs that can update in real-time:

Part 1: Feeding and nappies plot 

Plot the times when activities have taken place. Time along the y axis and day along the x; with "activities" plotted according to the time it was logged. The closest graph that I imagine this would look like is a scatter graph, but I want to see where these activites are clustering on a daily basis to compare

For example:

Part 2: Mapping sleep times per day

For example:

We can calculate the length of time of each of his sleeping times but would like this on a graph for easy visualisation.

Part 3: simple data summarisation
number of dirty nappies, sleeps, sleep duration, etc (I could do this in excel, but to keep it all in one plcase)

Stretch
Have fun predicting!
